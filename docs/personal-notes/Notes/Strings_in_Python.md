# Strings in Python

[[000_Index_DS_Algo]]
[[Collections_in_Python]]

- The name of class for strings is `str` . It's **NOT** string.

- To create new strings from other types use

```python
newStr = str(x)
```

- strings are **immutable**.

- concatenate two strings with `+` to create a new string.

- Individual characters can be accessed using `[]` and <u>zero based</u> _index_.

- Negative index starts counting from end.

```python
n = str(9876)
print(n[-1])    # 6
```
